Module 7 Final Project for CS-330
## How did I approach designing this scene?
For this scene, I first learned the basics of setting up the environment and all the key aspects to initially rendering an image and applying texture to an object.  From there, I practiced developing the basic shapes I would need for my scene.  After that, I continuously looked at the scene photo to properly place the objects in relation to the other objects, angles, and space between objects.


## How do I approach developing programs?
To develop programs, I first begin with a problem or a question that needs an answer.  Then, I systematically dissect that problem or question into smaller problems or questions.  After that, I develop pseudocode to solve each systematic milestone.  Lastly, I develop the code, preferring to keep things as decoupled and modular as possible.


## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me in reaching my goals by giving me another tool in my tool shed to creatively solve problems.  There are many problems with the world, but with persistence and a focused vision of solving it, opportunities for development exist.
